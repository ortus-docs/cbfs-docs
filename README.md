# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/CBFS-M.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>ColdBox File System Abstraction = cbfs</p></figcaption></figure>

The `cbfs` module will enable you to abstract **ANY** filesystem within your ColdBox applications. You can configure as many disks as you wish to represent file systems in your application. Each disk is backed by a storage provider and configurable within your ColdBox application.

## Storage Providers

The available storage providers are:

* **Local** - A local file system storage provider.
* **Ram** - An in-memory file storage provider.
* **S3** - An Amazon S3, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, or Google Cloud Storage provider.

## System Requirements

* Lucee 5+
* Adobe ColdFusion 2018+
* Java 11+

## Versioning

cbfs is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) guidelines as much as possible. We number releases in the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and reset the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
